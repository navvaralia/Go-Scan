Retail growth in Indonesia is having it’s ups and downs for last couple of years and the fact there’s pandemic making it more challenging for the retail business sector but with all of that, the retail sector in Indonesia manage to grow it’s percentage of sales up to 15.42%	which indicates the purchasing power of Indonesian citizen is recovered after pandemic.

So with that in mind, our team came up with a small solution to help easing peoples needs to do their daily goods shopping in their nearest retail shop with managing their shopping list so that user will know exactly the better price for their goods.

As to how our team project works, the user will inputting their shopping list and when they get to the retail shop they will taking photo of the product and then the system will calculate the total amount of the product they could get and then adding that item to their shopping cart in the system. By doing that management, we believe that user will have a better way to navigate their shopping by showing their total amount of shopping price.

We see that currently many small business like a stall are doing payment calculations manually which might lead to errors in the amount and longer time, and even big supermarkets don't have this feature in their applications yet. therefore we make this application to help transactions between sellers and buyers and enable buyers to manage their finances. This application is expected to help develop MSMEs in Indonesia and be able to work with companies in the retail sector.
